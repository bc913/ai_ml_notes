## Supervised Learning
- Regression Based
    - Linear
    - Logistic
- Classification Based
    - Decision Tree: Decisions are based on some conditions.
    - Random Forests: Builds multiple decision trees and merges them together.
        - More accurate and stable prediction
        - Trained with bagging method
    - Naive Bayes: Based on Bayes theorem which relies on conditional probability.
        - Assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class unrelated to the presence of another feature.
    - K-Nearest Neighbor: Classification is based on similarity measure
